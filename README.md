<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
In this use case, we walk through a real-world scenario of handling a critical issue in a banking environment: the entire mobile and online banking system is down. <br /><br />

This example demonstrates how an organizationâ€™s help desk and IT support teams coordinate to identify, address, and resolve a high-priority issue while ensuring clear communication and documentation at every step. <br /><br />

The goal of this example is to showcase best practices for:

- Ticket Creation and Intake: Accurately capturing the problem reported by the end-user.
- Assignment and Communication: Properly prioritizing, categorizing, and assigning the issue to the right team.
- Incident Resolution: Executing a systematic approach to diagnosing and fixing the issue.
- Documentation and Reporting: Providing a detailed resolution log for accountability and future reference.

This scenario emphasizes the importance of efficiency, collaboration, and clear communication in handling critical service outages, ensuring minimal disruption for users and a swift return to normal operations.

<h3>Step 1: Ticket Creation (Intake)</h4>h3>

<p>

</p>

The representative logs into the ticketing system and reads through the initial problem reported by the end user:
"Entire mobile/online banking system is down."

They check for related tickets or system alerts to confirm the scope of the issue.
They investigate the root cause by consulting server logs, system health monitoring tools, and team updates.

<h3>Step 2: Viewing the Ticket Properties (Assignment & Communication)</h3>
<p>
After analysis, they determine that the system is down due to a server overload from an unexpectedly high number of users trying to log in simultaneously.
</p>
    
<h3>Step 3: Working the Issue (Resolution)</h3>
 The representative coordinates with the IT team to: </br></br>

- Increase Server Capacity: Temporarily allocate additional resources to handle the current load.
- Implement Traffic Throttling: Manage the number of users accessing the system to prevent further strain.
- Restart Affected Systems: Restart specific services or servers to restore normal operations.
- Test the System: Conduct internal testing to confirm that users can access online banking without issues.
 
<h3>Step 4: Confirm the Resolution</h3>

Once the issue is resolved, the representative ensures: </br>

- Internal testing is successful across various devices and platforms (e.g., mobile apps and browsers).
- External feedback confirms users can log in and perform transactions without errors.

<h3>Step 5: Document the Resolution</h3>

<p> The representative updates the ticket with a detailed resolution note to keep a record of the issue. For example: </br>

Problem Identified: </br> </br>
The online banking system experienced a server overload due to an unexpectedly high number of concurrent users. This caused intermittent access issues and system downtime for all users. </br> </br>

Action Taken: </br>

- Identified the root cause via server logs and performance monitoring tools.
- Scaled server capacity temporarily to manage the increased load.
- Implemented traffic throttling measures to prevent further overload.
- Conducted tests to confirm system stability.

Resolution Confirmation: </br>

- System functionality restored as of [Time and Date].
- Verified normal operations through internal checks and user feedback.

Next Steps (if applicable): </br>

- Scheduled a review of server capacity and traffic management policies.
- Recommended a permanent server upgrade to prevent recurrence.

Status: </br>
- Ticket marked as Resolved.
